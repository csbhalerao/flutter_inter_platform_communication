Flutter provide amazing support for platform specific code. 
Flutter's platform-specific API support rely on a flexible message passing style between flutter code and native language code. It's simple host and client mechanism to pass messages.
The Flutter portion of your app sends messages to its host, the iOS or Android portion of your app, over a platform channel.
The host listens on the platform channel, and receives the message. It then calls into any number of platform-specific APIs - using the native programming language - and sends back a response to the client, the Flutter portion of your app.
